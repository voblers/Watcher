To have a server check the request''s headers, a client must send Expect: 100-continue as a header in its initial request and receive a 100 Continue status code in response before sending the body. The response 417 Expectation Failed indicates the request should not be continued.')
INSERT INTO RESPONSECODES VALUES(101,'Switching Protocols','The requester has asked the server to switch protocols and the server has agreed to do so.')

Therefore, HTTP/1.1 added status codes 303 and 307 to distinguish between the two behaviours.[22]\u00a0However, some Web applications and frameworks use the 302 status code as if it were the 303.')

For example, a POST request should be repeated using another POST request.')

This should be used when a resource has been intentionally removed and the resource should be purged. Upon receiving a 410 status code, the client should not request the resource in the future. Clients such as search engines should remove the resource from their indices.')

INSERT INTO RESPONSECODES VALUES(415,'Unsupported Media Type','The request entity has a\u00a0media type\u00a0which the server or resource does not support. For example, the client uploads an image as\u00a0image/svg+xml, but the server requires that images use a different format.')
